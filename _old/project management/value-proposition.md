Innovative tech companies always face the challenge to communicate the greatness of their products to the masses. 

Web-animations like mine can inform and educate potential users in a fun and effortless way from the very first second.

This will increase interest, understanding, engagement, retention, conversion and all those goodies you want when launching a great product.

You want someone to buy, try, click or download something.
My take on that is Entertain to Educate to Persuade â€“ and to do that with love and good intentions.
