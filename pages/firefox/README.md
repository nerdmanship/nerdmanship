# A Prototype That Made It All The Way To Firefox

(Sept 2016)

![Header][firefox-project_img]

#### [Launch demo][firefox_animation]

## Summary

* One of my first personal prototypes, picked up and used by Firefox
* Made to demonstrate brand storytelling values in web animation
* Big innovative brands like Firefox see the great value in web animation
* The novelty of web animation is a value in itself. It breaks the noise.

## Quotes

### "Really nice job! Love what you did with the animation."
> **Ty Flanagan** – Creative Lead, Mozilla Firefox

### "Super fluent & masterfully executed animation!"
> **Peter Mueller** – Art Director, Razorfish

### "Exactly what I've been imagining for a wow moment when users first open the browser."
> **Sevaan Franks** – Staff Product/UX Design, Mozilla Firefox

## About the project

If you take a look at Firefox’s [original website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) you’ll notice that it’s really well made. The message is super clear – 'Freedom'. The fox is gazing over an open landscape and the copy is themed accordingly. In it’s simple form, this is great storytelling. It says something important about the brand and the product, and people will surely leave the page feeling good.

As a web animation experimentalist, I thought:

> Hey, this is a perfect way to demonstrate how web animation can drive both emotion, story and message, and ultimately engagement. What if you would start the web experience by soaring over the landscape? Striking!

So I snatched the graphics and wrote the animation. The code was crude, but it turned out great.

I shared it on Twitter and offered Firefox to sue my for copyright infringement. But they didn't. Instead they loved it and we started to talk.

The prototype I made was experimenting with the main download page – which was 'suboptimal' UX-wise, as I wrote about in [the animation info][firefox_animation] – but Firefox had been wanting to use something similar in their onbaording experience where it made much more sense UX-wise.

The prototype was used as a reference through-out the design process and in March 2017 their new onboarding experience was done. You see it live after [downloading](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?scene=2) and launching Firefox:

I'm very proud of my contribution and super happy to see big industry leaders recognise the value in bringing web experiences to life!
