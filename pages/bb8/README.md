## About the project

I'm not a blockbuster kind of guy, but I just can't resist when it comes to Starwars. It's such a captivating saga. The divine Force that connects us all, the inner battle against evil, and of course the little companion droids. BB8 is such a well designed character. While recognising some reused features from R2D2's lovable personality, we also so see a reinvented droid with his own quirky style and functionality.

Making a BB8 graphic (SVG) and bringing him to life (GSAP) was my way of getting some quality time and getting to know the little guy.
