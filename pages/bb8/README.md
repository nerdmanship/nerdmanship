## About the project

I'm not a blockbuster kind of guy, but when it comes to Starwars I just can't resist. It's such a captivating saga. The divine Force that connects us all, the inner battle against evil, and of course the little companion droids. BB8 is such a well designed character. While recognising some reused features from R2D2's lovable personality, we also so see a reinvented droid with his own quirky style and functionality.

Making a BB8 graphic (SVG) and bringing him to life (GSAP) was my way of getting some quality time and getting to know the little guy.

This project was made to explore an idea I had about generating randomised movement. Inspired by an Adobe After Effects feature called *nullObjects*, I wrote a script that would generate random values and animate chosen graphical elements synchronously to those values. If you're interested, read my thoughts on it [here][bb8-info].

Since creating the prototype this technique has matured and provided endless value in terms of creative opportunities, smart code and performance to my projects. The massive response from the creative coding community was a very pleasant bonus!

Another reason was to explore the process of creating interactive and engaging cartoon-inspired animations for websites. In the end, I want to use similar methods to communicate the user value of my clients' innovative products.
