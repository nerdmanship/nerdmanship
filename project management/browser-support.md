# Browser support

All projects aim to support all currently supported browsers.

Supported browsers:
* Browser
* Browser
* Browser
* Browser

Any project can be designed to support browsers older than the currently supported ones, if that's a priority for the client. I normally advice against it as it means significant creative restrictions as well as more resources spent on quality assurance and troubleshooting. What browsers the project should support is always the result of a discussion and consultation with the client. I can always offer satisfactory fallback solutions for legacy browsers.
