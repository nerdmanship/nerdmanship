## About the project

Verdict MMA is an app concept - much like the popular Fantasy Football - where users interact with live Mixed Martial Arts events both by scoring rounds in real-time and making essential fight predictions before the events. The results of scoring and predictions are compared to friends and players around the world.

### Purpose of the animation
Promote the Verdict MMA application by grabbing the attention of potential users at the very first second. Get MMA fans excited with engaging and relatable content and show them the main use case and the context of which the app is used.

### About the animation and technology
This is vector animation with javascript. All graphics are inline SVG and all animation is javascript enabled by the Greensock Animation Platform – [GSAP](https://www.greensock.com).

An animation sequence like this is a technologically robust and experientially superior way to quickly show what an innovative product or service is about. It's made to be equally informative as entertaing.

On the technological end you have both graphics and animation that is purely made of code in languages that the browsers have spoken natively more or less since its birth – XML and JavaScript. Even ancient browsers understand it, making this new animation technique surprisingly backwards compatible, robust across platforms and easy to work with.

Since it's code-based it weighs virtually nothing and it loads instantly, which is the first pillar of an excellent user experience. Unlike video media it behaves consistently on both desktop and mobile devices.

To us, web-animation is a tool for great user experience. There is much more to say about both technological and experiential benefits of this animation technique. We are very keen to get in touch with fellow animators (since we still seem to be few around the world) and of course potential clients, so please [reach out (email)](mailto:johan@nerdmanship.com) if you feel like it.
